# playnice

A library to help you serve HTTP standard responses and be lenient with HTTP requests.

## Philosophy

1. Make it easier to serve HTTP standard responses without confounding
   HTTP logic with business logic.
2. Make it easier for limited or non-standard clients to access resources.
3. As much as possible separate orthogonal functionality into composable chunks.

## Quick Start

Add this to your dependencies:

  [playnice "0.0.4"]

## Use it!

Please use it and send your patches. I'd love to hear your feedback.
Just create an issue in github.
